I am glad to be here today
today is Easter Sunday

The father of two British-Israeli sisters killed in a shooting in the occupied West Bank embraced their 
bodies while mourners sang songs of grief at their funeral on Sunday.

Maia and Rina Dee, 20 and 15, were killed on Friday when suspected Palestinian gunmen opened fire on them 
in their car in the Jordan Valley.

Their mother, Leah, is in a critical condition following surgery.

The attack came amid soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions and violence.

The low rhythmic songs swelled and swayed with the crowd, who were packed beneath the white rafters in 
the prayer hall at a cemetery in the settlement of Kfar Etzion.

Many at the funeral were teenagers - some from the school Rina went to. At the front, by a low podium, 
the family gathered, talking together and holding each other for long moments in silence.
